## Overview <a id="chapter1"></a>

The diagram shows the iteration process when training a custom object detection model. Teams will be required to use two online platforms mainly [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) for labelling of new images and [google colab notebook](custom-yolov5-object-detection.ipynb) for augmentation, training and evaluation of models. 

## Dataset <a id="chapter2"></a>

A baseline dataset that is labelled has been included and can be found [here](/data). This baseline dataset includes a total of 90 images, 30 from each category. Teams are required to collect more images and label them accordingly for training of the custom object detection model for the competition. 

### Object Categories <a id="chapter1.1"></a>

There are 3 categories, humans, valuables and lights. Each category can then be subdivided into subcategories. Below are the list of objects that will be present in the terrain of the competition.

    <img src="/.github/images/human1.jpg" width="100" title='testing3' />
    <img src="/.github/images/human1.jpg" width="100" title='testing4' />

## Labeling <a id="chapter2"></a>

Before teams can proceed to train the model labelling of the new images will be required. Below is a guided tutorial on how to label the images. Teams can obtain the label.txt file [here](/data/labels-list.txt).
