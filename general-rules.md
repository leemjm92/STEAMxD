## STEAMxD Competition 2022 <a id="chapter1"></a>
STEAMxD is a competition where undergraduate student groups would learn the basics of object detection algorithms, AI model training and ethics. They would be using robots to navigate through a game arena and making ethical decisions along the way, scoring points for determining the winner for the competition. 


## General Rules <a id="chapter2"></a>

### Fundamentals <a id="section-2-1"></a>
1. No team should be sharing the same laptop or robot program. It will be deemed as cheating if any team is found to do so, and will be immediately disqualified from the STEAMxD.
2. If a team is found to use identical model/solution for the object detection component, an investigation will be carried out and the team will be required to justify the originality of their model/solution.
    * Images, labels, model files, logs and/or photos of intermediate prototype with time stamps may be requested by the organising committee to support the investigation. Hence, we encourage all teams to properly document their work, and treat it as a good learning experience.


### Venue <a id="section-2-2"></a>
1. There are in total 2 important areas in the venue: the Competition Area and Preparation Area.
    * The Competition Area is where all the graded competitions will take place. Each team can only enter the competition area during their assigned time slot and have to leave the area upon finishing the challenge.
    * The Preparation Area is a holding area where teams that are not currently taking part in the challenge would be located. Each team will have their own designated area where they can have internal discussions, modify their strategy, observe other teams or simply take a rest.

### Prohibited Behaviours <a id="section-2-3"></a>
1. Damaging or destroying anything in the venue that the team does not own (e.g. game fields, tables, chairs, venue decorations, robots of other teams etc.).
2. Bringing any medium of communication (both electronic or otherwise) into the competition area or attempting to communicate with anyone outside the competition area when teams are in the middle of completing the challenge.
3. Bringing any food or drinks into the competition area. 
4. Teachers / other teams outside the competition area attempting to communicate with teams in the competition area.
5. Any other behaviours that the organising deem as directly/indirectly interfering with the competition or affecting other teams (e.g. use of dangerous items or inappropriate words, fighting, chasing etc.).

### Appeal <a id="section-2-4"></a>
1. Upon receiving their competition results, teams should carefully check and ensure the accuracy of all information in the results slip before signing off.
2. If any error such as miscalculation of marks or violation of the competition rules is discovered, the team can appeal to the judges within 10 minutes of receiving the results slip.
    * All appeals must be brought forward by a student of the team. 
3. Within 30 minutes of submitting an appeal, the corresponding team should submit all necessary supporting evidence to the judges for consideration.
    * Any evidence that might support the team’s claim is welcomed, including but not limited to photos, videos, audios or facilitator’s testimony etc.
    * The team can request for checking the official video replays if the appeal is regarding events that occurred during the robot run.
4. By default, each team has 1 chance to submit an appeal.
    * If the 1st appeal is successful, it will not consume any chance.
    * Otherwise, the team will be deemed as having consumed their chance and will not be allowed to submit another appeal.
5. The judges’ final decision corresponding to an appeal will be final and it will be delivered by the chief judge.
