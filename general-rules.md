## General Rules <a id="chapter2"></a>
### Fundamentals <a id="section-2-1"></a>
1. All teachers and team members must be pre-registered in order to enter the venue.
2. No team should be sharing the same laptop or robot program. It will be deemed as cheating if any team is found to do so, and will be immediately disqualified from the STEAMxD.
3. If a team is found to use solutions identical to external or online resources, or solutions that are clearly designed/made by adults, an investigation will be carried out and the team will be required to justify the originality of their solutions.
    * Logbook, design drafts and/or photos of intermediate prototypes with time stamps may be requested by the organising committee to support the investigation. Hence, we encourage all teams to properly document their work, and treat it as a good learning experience.

### Robots <a id="section-2-2"></a>
1. STEAMxD 2023 is for teleoperation FPV robots.
    * After the robot has been started (performed any action, e.g. moving, transforming, displaying etc.), the team would no longer be allowed to manually interfere with the robot (e.g. attempt to pick it up when stucked, etc.).

### Venue <a id="section-2-3"></a>
1. There are in total 3 important areas in the venue: the Competition Area, Preparation Area and Audience Area.
    * The Competition Area is where all the graded competitions will take place. Each team can only enter the competition area during their assigned time slot and leave the area upon finishing the challenge.
    * The Preparation Area is a holding area when teams are not currently taking part in the challenge. Each team will have their own designated area where they can have internal discussions, modify their strategy, observe other teams or simply take a rest.
    * The Audience Area is where teachers of various teams should stay during the STEAMxD, to allow them to observe the competition and take photos if they wish to. Participating teams will be permitted to come to the Audience Area and interact with their teachers when it is not their turn to compete. However, they will not be allowed to bring along any part of the robot or the robot in whole, nor can they bring their laptop(s) or any storage device to the Audience Area.

### Prohibited Behaviours <a id="section-2-4"></a>
1. Damaging or destroying anything in the venue that the team does not own (e.g. game fields, tables, chairs, venue decorations, robots of other teams etc.).
2. Bringing any medium of communication (both electronic or otherwise) into the competition area or attempting to communicate with anyone outside the competition area when teams are in the middle of completing the challenge.
3. Bringing any food or drinks into the competition area. 
4. Teachers / other teams outside the competition area attempting to communicate with teams in the competition area.
5. Any other behaviours that the organising deem as directly/indirectly interfering with the competition or affecting other teams (e.g. use of dangerous items or inappropriate words, fighting, chasing etc.).

### Teachers <a id="section-2-5"></a>
1. Generally, teachers’ main responsibility is to provide mentorship and guidance to the participating teams before the competition. They can also advise on potential strategies during the competition and help the students review their performance after the competition. 
    * The teacher should never directly work on/program the robot.
    * The teacher is not allowed to enter the Competition Area or Preparation Area throughout the competition.
    * Students can go to the Audience Area to discuss with their teachers when they are not currently completing the challenge in the Competition Area.

### Appeal <a id="section-2-6"></a>
1. Upon receiving their competition results, teams should carefully check and ensure the accuracy of all information in the results slip before signing off.
2. If any error such as miscalculation of marks or violation of the competition rules is discovered, the team can appeal to the judges within 10 minutes of receiving the results slip.
    * All appeals must be brought forward by a student of the team, not the teacher. 
3. Within 30 minutes of submitting an appeal, the corresponding team should submit all necessary supporting evidence to the judges for consideration.
    * Any evidence that might support the team’s claim is welcomed, including but not limited to photos, videos, audios or facilitator’s testimony etc.
    * The team can request for checking the official video replays if the appeal is regarding events that occurred during the robot run.
4. By default, each team has 1 chance to submit an appeal.
    * If the 1st appeal is successful, it will not consume any chance.
    * Otherwise, the team will be deemed as having consumed their chance and will not be allowed to submit another appeal.
5. The judges’ final decision corresponding to an appeal will be final and it will be delivered by the chief judge.
